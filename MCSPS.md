Retrieving an enchantment table.

5 diamonds (3 for obsidian, 2 for crafting)
1 book, requiring 1 leather and 3 paper, requiring 3 sugar cane stalks
Bookshelves, requiring 3 books each, requiring 3 leather and 9 paper, requiring 27 sugar cane stalks
## Problems discovered in the previous session which require further thought
* None
* What to do while the sugar cane is growing?
## During tonight's session I will be focusing on...
## Finished tasks
* Cave base co-ordinates saved.
* I'm digging a staircase down to diamond level in my chosen living location for future mining use (y=~-59).
  * Done. Reached bedrock here... strange. They probably changed it in a new update.
* Planted sugar cane.
