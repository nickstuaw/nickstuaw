# Notes for my Minecraft Singleplayer Survival World
## Timings
* Began: `04/09/2023 19:25`
* Session length limit per day: 20 minutes.
* Session frequency: Intermittent but frequent.
* Time played as of `Thursday` night: `0.86h`
## Currently working on...
Placing stair blocks on the staircase.
## Problems discovered in the previous session which require further thought
* My bed was blown up by the creeper encountered on Thursday night (7/9/23). I need to find or make a new bed. 1 wool in chest so I should return to the village.
## During tonight's session I will be focusing on...
Rejuvenating my inventory.
Fetching a bed from the closest village.
## Finished tasks
* Cave base co-ordinates saved.
* I'm digging a staircase down to diamond level in my chosen living location for future mining use (y=~-59).
  * Done. Reached bedrock here... strange. They probably changed it in a new update.
